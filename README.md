# HTML Portfolio Project (Practice Only)

This repository contains a simple HTML portfolio website that I built for learning and practice purposes. It includes a main portfolio page and a few small demo projects such as a Movie Ranking page and a Birthday Invite page.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This is **only a practice project** created while learning HTML.  
> It is **not a real-world or production-ready project.**
